_________ Description _________
PLAY will be a database system to hold statistics pertaining to the English Premier League. 
The English Premier League is a Division I football league.  
It contains a total of 20 teams, each of which is allowed 25 players who play a total of 38 games in a season. 
This system was a great choice for us because it will be based on data that we find mutually interesting.  
We believe that choosing a system we find interesting to be beneficial, 
because it will keep us on task and motivated to do the best we can in providing a finished product.  
Furthermore, there will be more than enough data to fulfill the project’s structural requirements.  
For example, there are plenty of choices to choose from to meet the Table requirement. 
This database will include tables such as Team, Player, Game, Manager, Play, and PlaysFor. 
A user will be able to look up information on specific teams as well as their relative schedules. 
The goal of the project is to create a dynamic web application able to query and hold any Premier League statistics. 
This application will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create a web page that adapts to queries requested. 
Popular queries could include: schedule, team rankings, or how well a team is doing. 
We intend on making this application as versatile as possible, 
meaning we want it to be able to query just about anything someone would want to know pertaining to the Premier League.


_________ Functionality _________

View overall standings throughout the league.
Advanced query: subqueries

Check the performance of a specific team.
Advanced query: use aggregate functions to count wins/losses. These performances would be returned with an ordering by date so a order by clause may be necessary.

Check the schedule for a specific team.
Advanced query: use joins on teams and their games

Find top 10 games.
Advanced query: use limit, order by, and joins


_________ Stakeholders _________
This web based application will keep track of current Premier League statistics that can be accessed from anywhere by anyone. 
A one stop shop allows any Premier League fan into the current status of any Premier League team, player, or standings. 
This application will simply query what information the user want to know about.



_________ Technical Requirements _________
The web application will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP to adapt the webpage to queries presented. Code will be shared via a home network drive known as the “Armory”. The Armory will contain all code used during the developmental stages of the product. The final product will be hosted on a raspberry pi apache web server which has already been set up with a dedicated IP Address. The IP Address is stated below.
